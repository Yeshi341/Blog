# OVERVIEW
A lot of managers responsible for preparing staff schedule spend hours every week putting together each day's schedule for each employee in a week. This task can be not only time consuming and costly for the business, but also many times frustrating for the managers themselves. So, I wanted to try my hand at automating as much of the process as I could using simple Python codes.

# Objective 
So, what is the goal I want to achieve?
I want to create a function or functions that go through the employees database and using all available information, plugs schedule values into a final schedule dataframe.

# Planning
At the planning phase, I am mainly asking questions that when answered will help achieve the main goal.
* What are the assumptions of the business?
* What kind of data will be collected?
* What are the constraints?
* How will I tackle the constraints?
* What do I want my final schedule structure to look like?

# Additional features
Additional plans are to put tests in place. Tests, that will check for certain things to make sure that the schedule meets all the requirements placed by the constraints of the staff model.
